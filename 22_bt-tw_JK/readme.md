K22 -- Reviewing other CSS templates
2024-11-19
time spent: 2

DISCO: 
- You can create a carosuel of images using Bootstrap.
- You can create cards using Tailwind CSS.
- Lots of customizations can be made using only the class for both CSS templates.
    - For instance, you can customize the properties of each text box (bold, color, size) as well as create animations like hover, etc.
- imgs can also be customized to fit your purpose.

QCC:
- There's a lot of things each of these frameworks can do; what can it not do? What are the limitations of each framework?
- What are some other cool things I could do with these frameworks?
- How does the script portion of the framework work (i.e., how does these frameworks work with JS).

q0:

q0b:
Verbal consultations with members in other groups (e.g., Group Potato).
Bootstrap Documentation (for clarity).
Tailwind Documentation (for clarity & expansion).

q1:
I personally prefer tailwind as I really enjoy the easily customizable classes (although all of them did provide the same method). Although the other frameworks were simple and easy to understand, I thought the logic behind tailwind was simpler and more efficient. Also, I had a lot of fun using tailwind to help create a ducky website :D.
