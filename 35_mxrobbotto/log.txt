It was pretty surprising that copilot made a flask app and almost completely mirrored our project on the first try.
It had a lot of the same files as well, but maybe that's just a github convention.
Copilot made an error in the code surprisingly, it added "]" after 'Post' for some reason.
It lacked some pretty basic features like navigation but it did get most of the other features right.
