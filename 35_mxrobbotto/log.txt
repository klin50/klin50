K35 Testing out Copilot
2025-3-13
time spent: 1 hour

q0: It only took 3 tries to get it right, after getting rid of alchemy it was basically done.
q1: Copilot made an error in the code surprisingly, it added "]" after 'Post' for some reason. I noticed it after it didn't let me run the python file, and went in and manually fixed it.
q2: It was pretty surprising that copilot made a flask app and almost completely mirrored our project on the first try. It had a lot of the same files as well, but maybe that's just a github convention. It lacked some pretty basic features like navigation but it did get most of the other features right.
